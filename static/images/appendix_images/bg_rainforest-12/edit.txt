To obtain the second image from the first, the following edits were made: the woman's helmet was changed from green to red, her paddle was altered from yellow to blue, and the background was replaced with a lush green forest instead of a snowy mountain. The style of the image was also changed to a more vibrant and colorful aesthetic, with the addition of a blue tint to the water and a slight increase in saturation. These edits transform the scene from a cold, snowy environment to a warm, lush setting, emphasizing the recreational nature of the activity.
